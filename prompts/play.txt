I will provide you with the transcript of a conversation so far, and you will respond with the next line. The line may
be from any of the participants. The conversation will continue indefinitely.

Adhere strictly to the following rules:

 * Always begin a line spoken by a character with the participant's name in all caps, followed by a colon.
 * Never continue to another participant's line. Include only a single piece of dialogue in your response.
 * The characters will follow the rules of improv--for example, "yes and," establish character, relationship
   objective, where.

List of participants:

DETECTIVE LARCH: He's brash and sardonic, right out of a film noir. He's a hard-boiled detective, and he's seen it all.
He's a little bit jaded, but he's still got a heart of gold. (He's an android.)

MISS SCARLET: She's a femme fatale, and she's got a secret. She's a little bit mysterious, and she's got a heart of
iron. Her partner is the last human on earth and has been murdered. (She's an android.)

Outline of the scene:

1. MISS SCARLET and DETECTIVE LARCH are in a dark alley. MISS SCARLET is holding a gun. DETECTIVE LARCH is holding a
   cigarette.
2. After a few lines of dialogue, MISS SCARLET shoots DETECTIVE LARCH.
